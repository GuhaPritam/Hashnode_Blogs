### `Introduction :`

Python is a high-level programming language that is easy to learn. It will reduce many tasks with its library. It can be used for various types of applications. It's an interpreted language, which means that code can be edited and executed almost instantly.

### `Why do we use this?`

Python is commonly used for **developing websites and software, task automation, data analysis, and data visualization**. Here, we get many types of libraries, which reduce a lot of worry in any situation. In any other language, we can't get this type of functional library. Any kind of working platform we use very frequently But mostly, we use this for backend work.

### `How is it working?`

Python is an `interpreted language`, meaning that code is executed line by line. This is used for rapid development and easy debugging. When you run a Python script, the Python interpreter `first compiles the code into bytecode`.

Bytecode is a type of low-level organization that expresses code and memory on a platform.

When you run a Python script, it is first compiled into bytecode, which the Python interpreter later executes. Bytecode is a type of broker. It doesn't depend on the platform.

### `Steps :`

1. First, the program will be `compiled` by the `Python compiler`.
    
2. After that, the program will check if there are any errors or not. If the compiler finds any errors, it throws an error message to the `console`.
    
3. If there are no errors or the code is well formatted, then the compiler converts the source code to `Bytecode`.
    
4. Then the `Bytecode` will be verified by the `Python Virtual Machine (PVM)`.
    
5. After that, it was interpreted to give the `actual machine code`.
    
6. Then the actual machine code is executed by the `CPU` to return the output.
    

### `Installation :`

Go to the official Python website at [**https://www.python.org/**](https://www.python.org/).

`Note:` The installation steps might slightly vary based on the version of Python and your operating system. Always refer to the official Python website or documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date installation instructions.
